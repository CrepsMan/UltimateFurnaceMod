The Ultimate Furnace Mod introduces a powerful, self-sustaining furnace to Minecraft with a leveling system and unique functionality, designed to simplify smelting and add a progression element.

# Here’s an overview:

### Self-Sustaining Smelting:
The Ultimate Furnace doesn’t need fuel in the traditional sense. It remains "active" and smelts items during the day automatically.
At night, the furnace cools down and begins a countdown timer. This timer can cause the furnace to stop if it isn’t upgraded, adding a sense of day-night dynamics to its operation.

### Leveling and Upgrades:
The furnace includes a leveling system that unlocks upgrades as the player smelts more items.
With each level-up, the furnace becomes more efficient or gains new abilities, improving the smelting experience.
Levels are achieved by reaching specific milestones in the total number of items smelted (e.g., 100, 500, 1000 items, etc.).
### Custom GUI Design:

The Ultimate Furnace features a custom GUI that is distinct from a regular furnace, using a unique texture.
The GUI includes an animated cook progress arrow that fills up only while items are actively smelting.
A fire icon is displayed only when the furnace is actively smelting, so players can see at a glance if the furnace is in operation.

This mod enhances Minecraft’s smelting process by adding a furnace that doesn’t rely on constant fuel, coupled with a rewarding progression system. It's ideal for players who want more control over smelting while reducing the need to manage resources like coal or lava. The custom GUI and visual feedback create a smooth, integrated experience in the Minecraft environment.
